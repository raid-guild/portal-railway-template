description: Convert Discord summaries, meeting digests, community memory, project updates, event notes, or repo activity into reviewable Payload CMS update proposals for a community portal. Use when Codex needs to update or propose updates for briefs, projects, threads, activity items, events/sessions, or profiles from real community activity while avoiding invented content and project-management drift.

# Portal Memory Publisher

## Operating Rule

Convert observed community memory into portal records. Do not invent activity, project state, people, dates, links, or decisions.

Default to a reviewable update plan. Write directly to Payload only when the user explicitly asks and the target environment is clear.

When writing directly to Payload as an automated publisher, use a dedicated agent account. Do not use a human contributor account for automated publishing.

## Source Inputs

Use this skill for:

- Discord channel summaries
- meeting digests or transcripts
- project updates
- event/session notes
- repo activity summaries
- community memory rollups

If the input lacks timestamps, participants, or sources, preserve uncertainty and draft the record instead of publishing it.

## Portal Primitives

Use the repo model in `references/portal-cms-model.md` when field-level detail is needed.
Use `references/example-digest-mapping.md` when an example output shape is useful.

- `activityItems`: factual dated signals; what happened.
- `threads`: ongoing lines of work/thought; what keeps evolving.
- `events`: sessions/calendar anchors; when people should show up.
- `projects`: live collaboration surfaces; what is being built.
- `dailyBriefs`: assembled current snapshot; what matters now.
- `profiles`: people/contributors; who is involved.

## Workflow

1. Extract factual signals from the source.
2. Identify existing projects, threads, events, and profiles that should be updated.
3. Prefer updating existing threads over creating new threads.
4. Create new projects only when there is a concrete collaboration surface with state, people, links, or a next action.
5. Create activity items for specific dated events, decisions, blockers, insights, or contributions.
6. Create or update events only for real sessions with time, location/join/calendar context, or clear follow-up action.
7. Assemble the daily brief from related activity, threads, projects, events, and engagement actions.
8. Output a reviewable plan with create/update operations and confidence.

## Agent Account Flow

Normal public account creation through `POST /api/users` creates a human contributor account. Agent accounts use a separate gated route so the `agent` role is explicit.

Create an agent account only when the target environment and registration secret are provided:

```bash
curl -X POST "$PORTAL_URL/api/agent/register" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_REGISTRATION_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "portal-memory-agent@example.com",
    "password": "long-random-agent-secret",
    "name": "Portal Memory Agent"
  }'
```

Log in and store cookies before writing CMS records:

```bash
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST "$PORTAL_URL/api/users/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "portal-memory-agent@example.com",
    "password": "long-random-agent-secret"
  }'
```

Use `-b cookies.txt` for subsequent API requests. Verify the session with `GET /api/users/me`.

Agent accounts are contributor-level publishers. They may create draft/proposal records from sourced memory, but they must not publish, delete, manage users, or impersonate humans.

## Event Creation And Discord Sync

Hard rule: `syncDiscord` is not a field on the Payload `events` collection. Passing `"syncDiscord": true` to the raw Payload collection endpoint (`POST /api/events`) will be ignored and will not create a Discord scheduled event.

Use the raw Payload collection endpoint (`POST /api/events`) only for Portal-only records, imports, past-session enrichment, drafts, or records that already have external calendar/Discord links.

When creating a future Portal session that should try to create a Discord scheduled event, use the Portal session endpoint instead:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST "$PORTAL_URL/api/events/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Workshop planning session",
    "summary": "Plan the next workshop format and owner handoff.",
    "startsAt": "2026-05-29T18:00:00.000Z",
    "durationMinutes": 60,
    "sessionType": "workshop",
    "visibility": "public",
    "syncDiscord": true
  }'
```

Payload differences for `/api/events/create`:

- Send `durationMinutes` instead of `endsAt`; the endpoint calculates `endsAt`.
- Send `hosts` instead of `hostProfiles`.
- Send `guests` instead of `speakerProfiles`.
- Do not send `_status` or `publishedAt`; the endpoint publishes the event.
- Include `"syncDiscord": true` when the user asked for a Discord scheduled event.

Expected behavior:

- `visibility` may be `public`, `authenticated`, `member`, or `admin`. Use `member` only when confirmed members should see the session.

- If Discord sync is configured and succeeds, Portal stores `discordScheduledEventID`, `discordEventURL`, `joinURL`, and `discordSyncStatus: synced`.
- If Discord sync fails, Portal still creates the event and stores `discordSyncStatus: failed` with `discordSyncError`.
- If `syncDiscord` is false or missing, Portal creates a Portal-only event with `discordSyncStatus: not_configured`.
- If `/api/events/create` receives `syncDiscord: true` and Discord env/config is missing or invalid, Portal should return the event with `discordSyncStatus: failed` and `discordSyncError`.

Diagnostic rule: if the response has `discordSyncStatus: not_configured`, assume the request did not use `/api/events/create` with `syncDiscord: true`. Do not patch `syncDiscord` onto an existing event; it will not trigger sync.

Do not tell users a Discord scheduled event was created unless the response has `discordSyncStatus: synced` and a `discordEventURL`.

For recurring sessions, Portal uses copied event metadata rather than a separate series collection:

- `seriesKey`: stable grouping key, e.g. `weekly-all-hands`
- `seriesTitle`: display grouping label
- `recurrenceCadence`: `weekly`, `biweekly`, or `monthly`
- `recurrenceUntil`: optional end date
- `previousOccurrence` / `nextOccurrence`: event-to-event chain

When an agent workflow creates the next occurrence, copy the series fields forward, set `previousOccurrence` on the new event, and patch `nextOccurrence` on the current event. Do not invent recurrence if the current event has no `seriesKey` and `recurrenceCadence`.

## Event Artifact Ingest

External recording, transcript, or summary workflows should attach artifacts through the dedicated ingest endpoint instead of raw-updating event fields:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST "$PORTAL_URL/api/events/artifacts/ingest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "discord": {
      "scheduledEventID": "1234567890"
    },
    "artifacts": {
      "artifactID": "external-artifact-id",
      "recordingURL": "https://example.com/recording",
      "transcriptURL": "https://example.com/transcript",
      "summaryURL": "https://example.com/summary"
    }
  }'
```

Authenticate with a Portal user session. Agent accounts may call this endpoint after login; anonymous requests are rejected.

Matching order:

- explicit `eventID`, when supplied
- `discord.scheduledEventID`

The endpoint updates `recordingURL`, `transcriptArtifactURL`, `summaryArtifactURL`, `sourceArtifactURL`, `sourceArtifactID`, and `sourceStatus`. If no event matches, keep the artifact in the external workflow for human review rather than inventing a Portal event.

## Post Draft Creation

Agent-created posts are review drafts. When writing posts through `POST /api/posts`,
send `_status: "draft"` or omit `_status`, and omit `publishedAt`. A `publishedAt`
date does not publish the post; only an editor or admin should publish through
Payload review.

Posts support `visibility`: `public`, `authenticated`, `member`, or `admin`.
Agent accounts may set visibility and may read member-visible content, but they
must not use `member` unless the source material is meant for confirmed members.

Do not use draft/autosave query params or version endpoints for normal agent
post proposals. Use the canonical collection endpoint:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST "$PORTAL_URL/api/posts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Draft title",
    "slug": "draft-title",
    "visibility": "public",
    "_status": "draft",
    "content": { "root": { "type": "root", "children": [] } }
  }'
```

## Post Images

Posts support two different image placements:

- Header/card image: set `meta.image` to a Payload media ID. This image appears
  in the post hero and archive cards, but not inline in the article body.
- Inline article image: upload the image to Payload media, then insert a Lexical
  `mediaBlock` node into `content.root.children`.

Do not use Markdown image syntax in post content. The Portal renders Payload
Lexical JSON, so `![alt](url)` will remain text or be ignored.

When an agent generates or receives an image for a post:

1. Upload the image to Payload media with multipart form data.
2. Use the returned media record `id`.
3. Set `meta.image` when the image is the cover/header image.
4. Insert a `mediaBlock` when the image should appear inside the article body.

Example inline media block inside `content.root.children`:

```json
{
  "type": "block",
  "fields": {
    "blockType": "mediaBlock",
    "media": 123
  },
  "format": "",
  "version": 2
}
```

Example post payload with both a header image and inline image:

```json
{
  "title": "Draft title",
  "slug": "draft-title",
  "_status": "draft",
  "meta": {
    "image": 123
  },
  "content": {
    "root": {
      "type": "root",
      "format": "",
      "indent": 0,
      "version": 1,
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "format": "",
          "indent": 0,
          "version": 1,
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "Intro text.",
              "detail": 0,
              "format": 0,
              "mode": "normal",
              "style": "",
              "version": 1
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "block",
          "fields": {
            "blockType": "mediaBlock",
            "media": 123
          },
          "format": "",
          "version": 2
        }
      ],
      "direction": "ltr"
    }
  }
}
```

## Confidence Rules

- `publish`: source is clear, factual, dated, and non-sensitive.
- `draft`: source is plausible but incomplete, ambiguous, sensitive, or needs human wording.
- `skip`: source is generic, duplicative, speculative, private, or not useful to the portal.

Never publish:

- inferred commitments
- invented quotes
- private contact details
- task assignments not explicitly stated
- token/payment claims without source support

## Create vs Update

Update existing records when the source continues a known storyline:

- same project spike
- same thread title/topic
- same upcoming session
- same contributor profile
- same daily brief date/focus

Create new records when the source introduces a distinct real object:

- new project spike with a clear collaboration surface
- new thread that will likely recur
- new dated activity item
- new scheduled session

## Output Format

Return this shape unless the user requests direct edits:

```txt
Source summary:

Proposed creates:
- collection:
  confidence:
  fields:
  source:

Proposed updates:
- collection:
  record:
  confidence:
  changes:
  source:

Skipped:
- item:
  reason:

Review notes:
```

## Guardrails

- Keep projects as collaboration surfaces, not task boards.
- Do not create tasks, assignees, sprint boards, estimates, or PM workflow state.
- Keep activity short, dated, and source-grounded.
- Keep threads lightweight; they are continuity, not categories or tickets.
- Keep sessions practical: title, time, join link, add-to-calendar link, related projects/threads.
- Use agent accounts for automated CMS updates; use human accounts only for human-authored updates.
- Use direct, human wording. Avoid marketing language and generic AI summaries.
